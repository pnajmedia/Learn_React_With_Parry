# Lesson 1

- Usage of Emmet, demonstrate [It is essential toolkit for web-developers. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full-fledged boiler plate code for writing HTML and CSS]
- Write "Hello World" using HTML
- Write "Hello World" using JS
- Write "Hello World" using React 
    - [Browser understand js but not React so we need to import Library]
    - Can be done using cdn (Content delivery network)
    - Both react & reactDOM are available as CDN, this alone puts the superPower of React in the project.
    - We need 2 files react is core file and rectDOM is useful for DOM operations/needed to modify DOM.
    - Why we have 2 files? React work on phones, iot, 3D and different places so it had to keep core file seperate.
